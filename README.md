# Microsoft Fabric

# Setup Azure Account
1. Verify Managament Groups
2. Verify subcriptions 
    -  Ensure user is owner of the subscription
3. Create resource groups 
    - Create needed resources 
    - Region = US - EAST
4. Ensure cost management is accessible 
5. Start Fabric Trial 
    - This is to get started and once we have migrated stuff update fabric capacity to F-16 (pay as you go)
    - Create a user like nuclues.analytics@protegrity.com 
        - We can use existing user but I do not want to alter existing environment.
    - Ensure this user has below privileges
        - Global Administrator (Not sure IT will give us this)
        - Fabric Administrator
    - Ensure this user is added as Owner to subscription IAM role assignment
    - Sign up for free trial using this user.
